# second-order_terrain_derivatives

These are MATLAB codes and data.
The file named “GaussianSurface.m” can run in the MATLAB and generate the elevation, slope, and aspect data. These data also have been saved in the file named "Data.mat".
The file named "FiniteDifference.m" is a function which will be used in the process of calcaulating second-order terrain derivatives.
The "CalSOA.m" and "CalSOS.m" files also can run in the MATLAB and generate the results of SOA and SOS for Gaussian surface respectively.
